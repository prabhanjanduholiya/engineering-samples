## Ten design principles for Cloud/Azure applications

Follow these design principles to make your application more scalable, resilient, and manageable.

##### (1). Design for self healing. 
In a distributed system, failures happen. Design your application to be self healing when failures occur.

##### (2). Design for evolution. 
All successful applications change over time. An evolutionary design is key for continuous innovation.

##### (3). Make all things redundant. 
Build redundancy into your application, to avoid having single points of failure.

##### (4). Minimize coordination. 
Minimize coordination between application services to achieve scalability.

##### (5). Design to scale out. 
Design your application so that it can scale horizontally, adding or removing new instances as demand requires.

##### (6). Partition around limits. 
Use partitioning to work around database, network, and compute limits.

##### (7). Design for operations. 
Design your application so that the operations team has the tools they need.

##### (8). Use managed services. 
When possible, use platform as a service (PaaS) rather than infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

##### (9). Use the best data store for the job. 
Pick the storage technology that is the best fit for your data and how it will be used.

##### (10). Build for the needs of business. 
Every design decision must be justified by a business requirement.
